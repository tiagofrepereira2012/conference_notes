# AMLD 2026

## Opening talk

## ML and molecules

**OpenBind: Unlocking Protein-Ligand Binding Prediction**

The talk is about papers on how new works can find new protein structures.
No introduction.

Challenges - Data and methods

Q: how cut-off physically not possible structures on the difusion objective?
A: RL that plays with the reward function with physcally impossible structures.


ASAP antiviral consortium.

**Discovering small molecules from nature using DreaMS neural network**

How to discover new molecules? Mass spectrometry.
His job is to go from mass spectrometry to molecules. DreaMS project 


**Generative AI for Structure-based Drug Design**

Large Drug Discovery model: Use a learning objective that some parts of the signals is masked and you try to learning missing gaps.
diffusion models for instance. 

BAIO LABS

## AI Safety & Alignment (session 1 of 2)

**The emerging discipline of AI psychology** -- KOSINSKY

Searle Chinese Room metaphore.

Theory of mind-- Evaluate LLMs theory of mind (kosinsky)

## Swiss AI Initiative - Foundations of a National AI Innovation Ecosystem

Swiss AI initiative provides computing infrastructure to train base-models
so access to computing for large scale data research is acessible.

**Large Foundation Models for Climate and Weather**

Humidity and temperatur at different surfaces and altitudes. They leverage from multiple datasources,
synthetic, different density.

- AtmLLM model. Tokens of atmospheric data. --> Self supervised
    Q: What is a token in the atmospherical domain (z500, t2m)?

- ESFM model (aurora approach). Self supervised

**Foundation models for modeling the complexity of life**
Iris technology.

COSMIC: Cross-modal morphology-transcriptome model (22M microscopic images)


The platonic representation hypothesis

Imune I Foundation model.. Supervised approach and autoencoder.


**Foundations of Multimodal Learning**

- Definition on what is multimodality, which is a greater goal than just combining
sensors, modalities and fusion.

- Core function. Learn anything from anything.

- 4M: Massively multimodal masked modeling

- Predicting on the pixel space or abstractr space (latent variable)

- ANON-1: 1B parameter multimodel foundation model for astronomy

- FlexTok (tokenizer)

- The need to fine tune the tokenizer to have light-weight representation. HOW IS THIS CARRIED OUT ON SPEECH?


**Multimodal World Foundation Models for Physical AI**

Work on world models

Current state of the world + actions = Future state of the world

How can we use a world model?
 - Simulation
 - Policy training
 - Planning algorithm
 - Data generator

 The role of desantangling factors for video generation

 He showed an example from his papaer showing how to generate long videos.

He mentioned a work CALLED representation alignment for Generation ICRL 2025 that can speed up
a difusion model encoder

 **Foundation Models Bridging 4D Capture and Dexterous Manipulation for Surgical Digital Twins**

 Surgical digital twin example of a surgery room.
 They want o create a simulated environment so people can practice the craft in a simulated environnet.

 How do assess that this actually helps.
